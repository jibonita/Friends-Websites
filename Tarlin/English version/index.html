            <h2>Plastic threaded rods from Polyacetal (POM) and Nylon (Polyamide PA-66)</h2>
            <p>The technical (or engineering) plastics are wide used in the last years, because of theirs extraordinary strongest, durability, resistance to impact, hardness, creep resistance and high impact strength, even at low temperatures. They are physiologically safe (suitable for food contact) and has very good electrical insulating and dielectric properties with excellent chemical resistance to dissolving agent, acids and mineral oils. The technical plastics products are with low levels of humidity absorptions and can work long time in hot water.

            <h2>What kind of material we have to choose for the threaded rods?</h2>
            <p>Today all plastic threaded rods are made from Nylon (PA-6 and PA-66) and if you want, we also produce threaded rods from Nylon too, but why we strongly recommend Polyacetal (POM):</p>

            <h2>Polyacetal (POM) vs Nylon (Polyamide PA-66):</h2>
            <p>The POM is unbreakable in practice if you don’t cut it or batters it of course. Regardless of the power of the impact over this material you won’t find any micro cracks which are one of the biggest problems of Polyamides (the European name of Nylon). The Polyacetal (POM) has much more ruggedness (5 to 7 times) than the Nylon, but the great benefit is extraordinary creep resistance of the Polyacetal (POM). This material doesn’t extend before it breaks. When we speak about threaded rods, this is too important quality of the material. The Polyacetal (POM) is breaks easier than the Polyamide PA-66 (one of strongest Nylons), but the threaded rods from Polyacetal (POM) are stronger than threaded rods from PA-66.</p> 
            <p>Why it is that?</p>
         
                
            <p class="example"><u>Example</u>:&nbsp; Threaded rods from Polyamide PA 66 with diameter 10mm (just over 3/8" Inches) with two nuts in the both ends – can stand tension <strong>up to 330kg (728 pounds)</strong> and the thread start to creep (extend). Due to this creeping - the nuts go out of the rods and it makes no difference where exactly are nuts on the rods... The same diameter threaded rods from Polyacetal (POM) can stand tension <strong>up to 430kg (948 pounds)</strong> and the hole threaded rods is breaking (not only the tread). And this is the right way as it should be.</p>
        
        
            <p>In other words: The tread of the rods must be stronger than the rods himself and it must not creep (extend). The rods have to break before the tread and this is the main quality of the threaded products. This quality has POM.  When we speak about the threaded rods <strong>the Polyacetal (POM) is 30% stronger than Nylon (PA-66).</strong></p><br />
            <p>We produce threaded rods from other high-tech plastics and materials; depend of the specific customer expectations. We may consult our clients about it.</p>
